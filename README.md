# ca-certificate-updater Proof-of-Concept program

ca-certificate-updater is a conceptual tool designed for automatic root certificate updates with minimal user intervention.

## 🔥 Features
- Retrieves the latest root certificate directly from the Certificate Authority (CA).
- Analyzes the Distinguished Name (DN) in the certificate to obtain the source link.
- Uses the OU field or additional X.509 parameters to locate the latest certificate version.
- Verifies expiration dates and consistency with the old certificate before installation.
- Automatically replaces outdated certificates in the system upon successful validation.

## ⚙️ Installation
Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenSSL

### Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
```sh
python ca-certificate-updater.py --cert /path/to/old_cert.pem
```
Options:
- `--cert` — path to the outdated root certificate.
- `--verbose` — enable detailed output.

## 📌 Notes
